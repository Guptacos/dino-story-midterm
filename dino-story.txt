Dino Story
By: Aaron, also Niko

Chapter 1
---------
A long long time ago, a ferocious Tyrannosaurus Rex named Teresa lived
next to a rumbling volcano in a swampy, smelly jungle. According to her neighbor
Terry the Pterodactyl, Teresa was the meanest dinosaur in the whole
jungle. Teresa spent most of her time stomping through the dense
undergrowth, roaring at smaller dinos that got in her way.

Chapter 2
---------
One day, Teresa fell into a river. Oh no! Since she was a T-Rex with tiny arms
she couldn't swim. But Terry swooped in and pulled her out, saving her
from certain death! They became friends, and everyone lived happily ever after.
